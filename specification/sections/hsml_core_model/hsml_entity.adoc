[[core-entity]]
=== Class: core:Entity

The class `core:Entity` corresponds to the base concept **ENTITY** in IEEE P2874 Section 6.6.2, defined as “that which is perceived, known, or inferred to exist, has existed, or is anticipated to exist”. As the root of the Spatial Web ontology, `core:Entity` provides the universal foundation upon which all other HSML classes are built.

**Key Requirements**

* **Identity**: Every `core:Entity` **SHALL** possess a Spatial Web Identifier (`core:swid`) conformant with W3C DID Core syntax.
* **Typing**: Every instance **SHALL** declare its specific class via the `rdf:type` property.
* **Extensibility**: The `core:Entity` model is designed to be subclassed to create more specialized types.

|===
| RDF Class | `core:Entity`
| Is Abstract | Yes
| Definition | An _ENTITY_ is “that which is perceived, known, or inferred to exist, has existed, or is anticipated to exist.”
| Subclass Of | `owl:Thing`
| Usage Note | `core:Entity` is an abstract class and **SHALL NOT** be instantiated directly. Only its concrete subclasses should be instantiated.
| Rationale | As the root of the Spatial Web ontology, `core:Entity` provides a uniform, extensible foundation for all HSML constructs, enabling polymorphic processing, universal identification, and semantic interoperability.

==== Properties

This section provides the detailed normative definitions for the properties of the `core:Entity` class.

[[core-entity-property-type]]
===== Property: type
.Property Definition: rdf:type
[cols="2,4"]
|===
|**Property** | `rdf:type`
|**IRI** | `http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type`
|**JSON name** | `@type`
|**Requirement Level** | **Mandatory**
|**Cardinality** | 1..*
|**Domain** | `core:Entity`
|**Range** | `rdfs:Class`
|**Definition** | Declares the specific class (or classes) of which this resource is an instance.
