____

`agt:Person` represents a human individual in the Spatial Web. While it inherits all the goal-directed and capability-driven characteristics of an `agt:Agent`, its primary distinction is its intrinsic link to a self-sovereign identity, ensuring individual control over personal data and interactions.

**Key Requirements**

* **Inheritance**: An `agt:Person` **SHALL** inherit all requirements from `agt:Agent`, including having a `core:swid`, `agt:hasGoal`, and `agt:hasCapability`.
* **Self-Sovereignty**: The `core:swid` of an `agt:Person` **SHALL** represent a self-sovereign identity, giving the individual ultimate control over their digital presence and credentials.
* **Personal Attributes**: An `agt:Person` **SHOULD** use properties from well-known vocabularies like `schema.org` to describe personal attributes for interoperability.
