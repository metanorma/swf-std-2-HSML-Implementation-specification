== HSML VectorSpace SubModule

=== Introduction

The *VectorSpace* submodule specializes the Hyperspace abstraction for **linear spaces**. It realizes the *VECTOR SPACE* concept of <<ieee-p2874,clause="6.2.x">> as a Hyperspace whose elements admit **linear combination over a scalar field**, with an abstract **origin** and **composable arrows** corresponding to linear displacements.

____
A vector space is a set whose elements can be added and scaled, satisfying linearity axioms.
In HSML, a `vector:VectorSpace` is a `hspace:Hyperspace` that also qualifies as a `metric:MetricSpace`, exposing linear and distance semantics **without prescribing** a particular element encoding or path representation.
____

This module is intentionally **representation-agnostic**. It defines vector-space semantics and mapping hooks while allowing deployments to bind coordinates, arrays, or geometries as needed. Vector spaces are used across the Spatial Web for **geometric coordinates**, **embeddings and feature spaces**, **signal/field representations**, and **local linearizations** of complex manifolds.

By design, a `vector:VectorSpace`:

* Inherits all properties of `hspace:Hyperspace` (elements, arrows, paths, operations).
* Inherits all properties of `metric:MetricSpace` (distance, polarity, axioms, metrics).
* Adds linear-structure hooks (scalar field, dimension, origin policy, CRS).

Prefix. `vector:`

.Key Requirements
* **Separation of concerns.** A `core:Domain` *owns* one or more hyperspaces via `core:hasHyperspace`; Vector Space contributes the **linear structure** for those spaces.
* **Linear + metric inheritance.** `vector:VectorSpace` inherits element/path semantics from `hspace:Hyperspace` and distance/similarity semantics from `metric:MetricSpace`.
* **CRS grounding.** Every `vector:VectorSpace` **SHALL** bind to an ISO 19111 CRS using a registry IRI (e.g., EPSG) so **axes, units, and frames** are unambiguous.
* **Dimensionality.** A vector space **SHALL** declare its finite dimension (e.g., `2` or `3`).
* **Representation-neutral.** The module does **not** impose vector/geometry classes; element/path encodings are mapped via Hyperspace declarations.
* **Operations-ready.** Vector spaces participate in Hyperspace operations (e.g., **subspace**, **direct sum**, **tensor product**) defined by the standard.

=== Normative Classes

This clause provides the normative definitions for all class concepts within the HSML **Vector Space** Submodule. Each class is detailed in a table that specifies its URI, description, JSON-LD context name, usage notes, and relationships to other classes.

The namespace prefix `vector:` refers to identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/hyperspace/vector#].  
Related prefixes (informative): `hspace:` → identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/hyperspace#], `metric:` → identifier:[https://www.spatialwebfoundation.org/ns/hsml/hyperspace/metric#].

| Class | Description

| <<vector-vectorspace,vector:VectorSpace>>
| Specialization of `hspace:Hyperspace` (and `metric:MetricSpace`) that provides linear-structure semantics and CRS grounding for interoperable coordinates.

| <<vector-crs,vector:CoordinateReferenceSystem>>
| First-class resource describing a CRS used to ground a `vector:VectorSpace`. Encapsulates the registry identifier and optional authority metadata.

| <<vector-normed,vector:NormedVectorSpace>>
| A `vector:VectorSpace` equipped with a norm; induces a metric on elements.

| <<vector-innerproduct,vector:InnerProductSpace>>
| A `vector:NormedVectorSpace` equipped with an inner product; induces the norm.

| <<vector-euclidean,vector:EuclideanSpace>>
| Finite-dimensional `vector:InnerProductSpace` with standard Euclidean structure (orthonormal basis exists).
